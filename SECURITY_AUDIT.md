# Security Audit - October 2, 2025

## 🔒 Security Cleanup Completed

This document records the security measures taken to ensure this public repository contains no sensitive information.

---

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. Credential Removal from Git History

**Issue Found**: Partial API key was exposed in `docs/TEST_RESULTS_OCTOBER_1.md` across multiple commits in git history.

**Resolution**:

- ✅ Used `git-filter-repo` to permanently remove credential from ALL git history
- ✅ Replaced all occurrences with `[REDACTED]` in 25 commits
- ✅ Verified complete removal from all branches and history
- ✅ Commit created: `316984f - security: Redact API credentials from test results documentation`

**Commands Used**:

```bash
git-filter-repo --replace-text <(echo 'EXPOSED_SECRET==>[REDACTED]') --force
```

### 2. Local Credential File Removal

**Issue Found**: `tests/.env` contained real API credentials (APP_KEY and APP_SECRET).

**Resolution**:

- ✅ Deleted `tests/.env` file completely
- ✅ File was never committed to git (properly ignored)
- ✅ `.gitignore` properly configured to ignore all `.env` files
- ✅ `.env.example` template remains for users to create their own

**Note**: Users must create their own `tests/.env` from `tests/.env.example` for testing.

### 3. Git History Verification

**Verification Steps**:

```bash
# Search entire history for credentials
git grep "EXPOSED_SECRET" $(git rev-list --all)
# Result: No matches ✅

# Search workspace for credentials
grep -r "app_key\|app_secret" --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.venv .
# Result: Only in code constants and examples ✅

# Verify .env is ignored
git check-ignore tests/.env
# Result: tests/.env ✅
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Measures in Place

### 1. Git Ignore Configuration

**File**: `.gitignore`

Protected patterns:

```
# CRITICAL: Never commit API credentials!
.env
*.env
!.env.example
```

Also ignores:

- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Virtual environments (`venv/`, `.venv/`)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Test artifacts (`.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`)
- Home Assistant secrets (`secrets.yaml`)

### 2. Tests Directory Protection

**File**: `tests/.gitignore`

Additional protection:

```
# NEVER commit actual credentials!
.env
```

### 3. Security Documentation

**Files**:

- `.github/SECURITY.md` - Security policy and reporting
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Developer guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

All emphasize:

- ❌ Never commit API credentials
- ❌ Never log full credentials
- ✅ Use environment variables for tests
- ✅ Mask secrets in logs (first 8 chars only)

### 4. Code-Level Protection

**Pattern**: All logging of credentials is masked

Example from `custom_components/solarguardian/__init__.py`:

```python
_LOGGER.info("🔧 App Key: %s...", api.app_key[:8] if len(api.app_key) > 8 else "***")
```

**Pattern**: Configuration uses Home Assistant's secure storage

```python
app_key=entry.data[CONF_APP_KEY],
app_secret=entry.data[CONF_APP_SECRET],
```

## 📋 Pre-Commit Checklist

Before every commit, verify:

- [ ] No `.env` files in staged changes
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys or secrets
- [ ] No exposed tokens in code
- [ ] Logs only show masked credentials (first 8 chars max)
- [ ] Test files use environment variables
- [ ] No user-specific paths or data

### Quick Verification Command

```bash
# Check staged files for potential secrets
git diff --cached | grep -i "app_key\|app_secret\|password\|token" | grep -v "CONF_\|example"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Users

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** - Create from `.env.example`
2. **Always mask secrets in logs** - Use pattern: `secret[:8] + "..."`
3. **Use environment variables for tests** - Never hardcode credentials
4. **Check before commit** - Run security scan commands above

### For Repository Owners

1. **Force Push Required** - Git history was rewritten
   ```bash
   git push --force origin master
   ```
2. **Old Credentials Invalid** - The exposed partial key should be regenerated
3. **Monitor Repository** - Set up GitHub secret scanning alerts

### Credential Rotation Recommended

Since a partial API key was exposed in public commits, even though now removed:

1. Consider regenerating API credentials in SolarGuardian platform
2. Update Home Assistant integration configuration
3. Update local `tests/.env` if you recreate it

---

## 🚨 What to Do If Credentials Are Exposed

If you accidentally commit credentials:

1. **Immediately Rotate Credentials**
   - Generate new API credentials
   - Update all systems using old credentials

2. **Remove from Git History**

   ```bash
   git-filter-repo --replace-text <(echo 'EXPOSED_SECRET==>[REDACTED]') --force
   ```

3. **Force Push to Remote**

   ```bash
   git push --force origin master
   ```

4. **Notify Repository Maintainers**
   - If not the owner, create a private security advisory

5. **Document the Incident**
   - Add entry to this security audit
   - Update security policy if needed

## ✅ Repository Status

### Security Status: **SECURE** 🔒

- ✅ No credentials in git history
- ✅ No credentials in current files
- ✅ No credentials in documentation
- ✅ Proper `.gitignore` configuration
- ✅ Security documentation in place
- ✅ Code-level masking implemented
- ✅ Test framework uses environment variables

### Ready for Public Repository: **YES** ✅

The repository is now safe to:

- ✅ Push to GitHub public repository
- ✅ Share publicly
- ✅ Submit to HACS
- ✅ Accept community contributions

### Required Action Before Push

**IMPORTANT**: Must use `--force` push because git history was rewritten:

```bash
git push --force origin master
```

This will overwrite the remote history with the cleaned version.

---

## 🔐 Credential Rotation Status

**Recommendation**: Rotate API credentials

**Reason**: Even though removed from history, a partial API key was briefly exposed in commits. Best practice is to regenerate credentials.

**Steps to Rotate**:

1. Log into SolarGuardian platform
2. Navigate to: System Management → Personal Information Management → Open API
3. Generate new `appKey` and `appSecret`
4. Update Home Assistant integration configuration
5. Update local `tests/.env` (if you recreate it)
