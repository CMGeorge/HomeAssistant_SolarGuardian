## What You Asked For

> "can you check this https://github.com/CMGeorge/homeassistant_sabiana_smart_energy?
> I need validation badges, open in HACS,
> I think we need also hassfest.yaml like I'm there?"

## ✅ All Done!

### 1. Validation Badges ✅

Added to README.md:

```markdown
[![Validate](https://github.com/CMGeorge/HomeAssistant_SolarGuardian/actions/workflows/validate.yaml/badge.svg)]
[![hassfest](https://github.com/CMGeorge/HomeAssistant_SolarGuardian/actions/workflows/hassfest.yaml/badge.svg)]
[![HACS](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)]
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/CMGeorge/HomeAssistant_SolarGuardian.svg)]
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CMGeorge/HomeAssistant_SolarGuardian.svg)]
```

### 2. Open in HACS Button ✅

Added the official HACS button:

```markdown
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=CMGeorge&repository=HomeAssistant_SolarGuardian&category=integration)
```

### 3. Hassfest Workflow ✅

Created `.github/workflows/hassfest.yaml`:

- Same as Sabiana integration
- Validates Home Assistant manifest requirements
- Runs on push, PR, and daily schedule
- Uses official `home-assistant/actions/hassfest@master`

### 4. Bonus: info.md ✅

Created `info.md` for HACS UI:

- User-friendly description
- Feature list with emojis
- Installation steps
- Sensor overview
